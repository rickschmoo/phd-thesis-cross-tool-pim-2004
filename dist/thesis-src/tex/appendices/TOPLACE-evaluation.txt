\textbf{Notes}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textit{NB: To place as appropriate in}:
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Literature Review (Chapter 2)
		\item Research Agenda (Chapter 4)
		\item Design and feasibility study (Chapter 5)
		\item Main Study/Evaluation (Chapter 6)
		\item Discussion (Chapter 7) -- a reflection on evaluation

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{The Need for evaluation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
	\item Need for effective evaluation (reference classic HCI methodology)
	\item Artifact on its own is not a contribution to knowledge
	\item Evaluation as theory-building
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Overview: types of evaluation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item What methods are available?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Objective task-centered/task-based evaluations
		\item Field-trial based evaluations
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Implications for method -- - discuss pros and cons of each approach (REF: Robson):
		
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluating PIM tools}

\textbf{Challenge of evaluating PIM tools}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
	\item Evaluation is difficult (REF)
	\item The challenges inherent in evaluation, compounded with PIM tools
	\item Compare with other complex activities, e.g. CSCL, user modelling (REFS)
	\item Difficulty of evaluation of complex tools/tasks ~\cite{ad:01}. 
	\item PIM is possibly an extreme.  Numerous methodological implications.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Hinted at by my experiences so far -- exploratory and feasibility studies. Relate lessons from earlier chapters.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Need for appropriate evaluation criteria
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How to conceive of/define usability for tasks such as PIM?
		\item Is usbaility an appropriate measure?
		\item efficiency -- moving towards process (strategies and habits)
		\item effectiveness -- moving towards outcome (achivement, result)
		\item satisfaction -- changing towards affect ("`how does it make you feel?"').
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Implications of cross-tool work -- further complexity and challenges.	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
	

\textbf{Examples that have been done}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}

	\item Overall lack of evaluations in PIM work, and reasons why -- and in particular lack of evaluation of ambitious systems as a user environment
	
	\item Examples that have been done:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Field-work: Rodden
		\item Laboratory: DataMountain etc., TopicShop~\cite{amento:99,amento:00}
		\item Consider commercial practice (long-term beta trials). Although typically unpublished.
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Doing the evaluation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Selection here: Field-trial}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
	\item provide evidence for based on nature of PIM, and type of tool
	\item PROS: consequences apparent only through the course of extended use, more realistic
	\item CONS: users select own tasks, difficult to compare
	\item OPTIONS: Long-term/short-term, own material/other peoples' material
	\item OPTIONS: choice of evaluation metrics -- Critical events/impact on "bugbears"/other problems
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Discussion/Post-evaluation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
		\item Reflection on my experiences
		\item Recommendations for future evaluation work
