\textbf{Chapter notes}:
\begin{itemize}

	\item \textit{THINK: Relate to overall PhD aims?}
	
	\item \textit{THINK: What am I trying to do here?}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item What it all means.  What I learned/gained
	
		\item Discuss/develop findings from the study
		%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		\begin{itemize}
			\item What does it all (the study/evaluation results) mean?. Questions raised.
			\item Can I generalise (from local findings to general design genre?)
			\item Build model/theory out of the evaluation data
			\item Extend cross-tool framework with findings from evaluation
			\item Implications for design -- towards design recommendations
		\end{itemize}

		
		\item Discuss the thesis overall
		%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textit{THINK: how do these insights relate/conflict to those from earlier study?. Can I frame as learning?}
			\item \textit{THINK: avoid overlap with the conclusion chapter}
		\end{itemize}

	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{To place in Discussion?}:
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Relative influence of study and tool}
		\item \textit{Suitability to novice users (hunch or more?)}
		\item \textit{Develop messy/tidy theme - is messy good?  What is messy? Drag in Mr. Men and that Economist article}
		\item \textit{Question assumptions of efficiency-based approaches and optimization in e.g. info foraging, Balter, Kirsh}
		\item \textit{Do users see personal workspace as intrinsically different to remote spaces?}
		\item Paradox of the supporting tool.  Trying to improve a tool that distracts people from what they're meant to be doing!

% LEAD-IN INTRO

\textbf{Start with an overview of the chapter}:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Discussion of study results from main study
		
		\item Discussion of evaluation results from main study
		\begin{itemize}
				\item particularly in terms of integrating into theory development.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item Methodological Discussion
		
		\item \textit{THINK: Relate to previous chapters}. This chapter builds on ...

\section{Discussion of Study Findings}
\label{ch7:study-discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{THINK: Need to think what are implications for design/further research?  (specific to WorkspaceMirror and general)}
	\item \textit{Present evidence -- and come up with possible interpretation/explanation}
\end{itemize}

	
\textbf{Cross-tool longitudinal View of PIM Practice} - key insights gained and consider implications for design:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
		\item Users employ a range of strategies. One user - multiple strategies depending on type of information being managed. Users are not "`messies"' OR "`Tidies"' - they tend to be a bit of both, depends on where you're looking.
		\item Model of typical user. Identify key problems.
		\item Cross-comparison of information types (contribution). Table. Yet tools are the same.
		\item Similarity of archived email and the document space.
		\item What were the main factors influencing the different tools/strategies?
		\item Relative unimportance of bookmarks
		
		\item \textit{THINK: use to extend CTF?}
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Aspects of PIM that we have gained greater understanding into}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\textbf{Highlight nature of PIM} - implications for design
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
		\item Irrational - efficiency not really a factor
		\item Supporting, lack of reflection (how tool and study in general prompted reflection)
		\item Barreau's break-down into four sub-tasks not necessarily that clear-cut
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In terms of definition, importance or frequency. In actual fact, quite fuzzy
		\end{itemize}
		\item Bugbears
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Satisficing nature of PIM. Becomes a problem, knock-on effect on productivity. Build-up over time.	
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion of Evaluation Findings}
\label{ch7:evaluation-discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{THINK evaluation should focus on overall potential rather than short-term design/implementation headaches -- or at least clearly differentiate}
	\item \textit{THINK: question with respect to conclusions = which are specific to my tool? Which can be generalized more widely for the Design of PIM Systems?}
	\item \textit{THINK: NB: not a comparative study}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Findings specific to WorkspaceMirror}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
	\item Overall - a measured success, or is this too optimistic?
	\item Unforeseen uses
	\item Many design suggestions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Much possible future work ...
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Suitability for some users. Can I characterise them?
	\item \textbf{BUT: Consider underlying problems - have they been dealt with?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item e.g. email overload - not really is honest answer
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{General Implications for the Design of PIM systems}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

General Implications for the Design of PIM systems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What do the results mean for design of future PIM systems/OS developers?
	\item These study results suggest counter-argument to unification - benefits of applications. Along lines of Norman's Information Appliance view~\cite{norman:98} - simple and specialized.
	\item Potential to unify may be limited - do users really want to manage spam in the same space that they are dealing with important documents? Many different forms of content which may have different management strategies.
	\item Potential to unify in terms of information type (ephemeral/archived). Relate to parts of collections.
	\item Universal Usability~\cite{Shneiderman:00}
	\item Identity Management~\cite{liberty:03,myservices:01}
	\item So many users -- so few tools.  Encourage variation in tools to match variation in practice.
	\item Promotion of reflection
\end{itemize}


	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methodological Discussion}
\label{ch7:methodological-discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Specific comments on study/evaluation methodology:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Choice of users
	
	\item Success (pros/cons) of cross-tool approach
	
	\item Success (pros/cons) of study/evaluation dual-purpose research vehicle
	
	\item Methodological recommendations (move to conclusion?)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Enough time to study long-term activity like PIM? This raises the question ...
		\item Success of different forms of data (esp diary)
		\item Triangulation in WET
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Impact of the Study - ecological validity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Relative influences of study and design on practice
		\item Impact of the study on user activity
		\item Hawthorne-like effect/or ecological validity - study changed behaviour. Questions over ecological validity. Always going to be a factor - how I chose to reduce impact
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Pro: increase in visibility of PIM
			\item Con: not as realistic as one might have hoped
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
