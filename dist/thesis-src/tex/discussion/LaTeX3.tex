Furthermore, in designing a PIM-integration mechanisms, cross-tool benefits should be balanced with possible downsides that may only be manifested in a tool-specific context. % from within the contexts of the tools that are affected.

BLAME TOOL OR USER: In many cases, users blame themselves rather than the PIM-tool.

% Therefore CHANGE?

THEREFORE CHANGE: One solution may be to change strategy to better deal with the information they accumulate. For instance, a user may consider acquiring less information. Alternatively, a user might consider managing more information using a frequent-filing strategy to deal with an overloaded inbox which results in the user loosing information.  However, many participants reported that making such changes involved major investments of time and effort.  As a consequence, users may accept non-optimal strategies, exacerbating a long-term impact on user experience. % EXPAND SCENARIO

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Ongoing activity yet based on short-term decisions, focused on ST barriers to LT benefits. 
% Focus on immediate satisficing (efficiency) versus possible long-term satisfaction. 
% Supporting nature - users tend to focus on the short-term, do nothing about the long-term problems 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% and this short-term focus, means that PIM can become a problem over the long-term.  
% acceptance of non-optimal strategies,   impact on long-term user experience
% Through making a series of short-term, satisficing decisions,  their long-term satisfaction may be impacted as some problems may require necessitate significant changes in PIM strategy, and therefore 
SUPPORTING MAKES IT WORSE: The supporting nature of PIM may contribute to this negative user experience.   Many participants stated that they tried to manage information in a systematic way, yet could only do so over the short-term via satisficing decisions based on immediate needs.

Value-based computing~(Friedman:03) may provide an appropriate route for doing so.
