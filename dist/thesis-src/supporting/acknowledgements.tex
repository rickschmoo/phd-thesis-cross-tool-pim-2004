\noindent
This thesis is dedicated to the memory of Chris Hubbard.  You were a great friend, and I really miss you.  You showed us how to be strong during the hardest of times.  

\noindent
I am very grateful for the advice and encouragement from my two supervisors, Bob Spence at Imperial, and Angela Sasse at University College.  I would also like to thank Patrick Purcell for his mentoring.  Thanks are also due to the time and interest of all the study participants (all 32 of you!). Without all of you, this work would not have been possible.

Many people in the HCI community also played a part: Jens and Gillian at UCL, Mark, Kirsten, Bill, Matt, Dana, and Sally-Jo at Waikato, Peter and Dianne of the British HCI group, Marilyn Salzman who mentored my CHI paper, Kerry at Google, Gina, Henrrry, Deidre, Gabe the dude, SongGirl, the Fhios gang (Phil, Malc, Anna, Jim, Sigur and Adrian), Priscilla, Michael M., Sharif ... the list goes on.

For most of my PhD, I thought no one cared about PIM ... but within the last year I've met a load of great people who do including Ofer, Jacek, Ian, Nick, Sarah, and William.

In no particular order: Oscar, Kaveh (you're next!), Yasmine, Paulo, Silvio (IT god 1), George, Pascalis, Tania, Choko, Emachi, Fernando, Secil, Tim G., the pacting team (RIP), Juan (my patient neighbour), Brendan (sorry about the biscuits), Sunny, Mark, Lloyd (IT god 2), Varol, Peter, Mike, 'Truro, Yu, Christina, Matt and his robot harem, Michaela, Yianis, Sunil, and last but not least ...

This work was supported by an EPSRC studentship.  Funding from the Royal Academy of Engineering made the Tokyo trip possible.  Lately the bank of ma and pa has also done its bit.

Lastly, hugs to Milena for all the time she had for me, all the waiting she did for me, and for being so warm and compassionate.
