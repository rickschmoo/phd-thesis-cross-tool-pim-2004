%Investigating How Individuals Conceptually and Physically Structure File Folders for Electronic Bookmarks: the Example of the Financial Services Industry
%Lisa Gottlieb, Juris Dilevko
%Published Online: 6 Dec 2002

% Gottlieb and Dilevko asked 15 graduate accounting and business management students to create electronic folders for 60 URLs and file bookmarks in the folders. Questionnaires tailored to each individual's work were then administered to determine the rationale for the decisions made both on folder scheme design and URL assignment. Any category, whether or not it contained URLs, or only sub-categories was counted as a folder. On the average 15.73 folders were created with a range from 6 to 31. Eight of the participants utilized superordinate folders containing primary folders with URLs. The average number of primary folders was 12.93 with a range of 6 to 24.  Seven participants created sub-folders, i.e. folders containing both URLs and other primary folders. Subject categories differed widely as did assignment criteria. It appears that intended use and relevance to current projects was a strong influence.
