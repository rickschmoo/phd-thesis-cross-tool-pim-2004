%Thinking about multiple classification: "I might also mention that any item can have user-defined attributes, as well as the ones which are standard for its type. Unlike conventional email clients, whose capability to permit user-defined attributes is limited to a fixed choice of labels or list of categories, Chandler allows an unlimited elaboration of user-originated ways of classification."

% Jared White writes "mediaVoom is an "ideaware" software project, meaning that it's currently a concept or specification only, not an actual program. mediaVoom is a brain-like information organizer that stores references to files in a flexible database along with a multitude of properties such as keywords, context, purpose, attributes, and more. mediaVoom features a highly-customizable next-generation user interface, extensive integration with system software and applications, and an advanced API for third-party extensions. For more information, please visit the mediaVoom Web site." The mediaVoom database is made up of Voom Orbits, or Vorbits for short. Each Vorbit contains a reference to a file on your hard drive, whether it be a word processing document, a spreadsheet, an image, an audio file, a Web address, an HTML file, or even an application. Along with this reference, a Vorbit can contain a title as well as one or more keywords, which help describe the contents of the Vorbit. Here is a conceptual screenshot, which demonstrates keywords, attributes, and links being assigned to an email message.

%SWAD SWAD-Europe Deliverable 12.1.1: Semantic web applications - analysis and selection 
%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%Personal information management 
% This category is concerned with applying semantic web techniques to help individual users manage their own information. Several of these have a strong community aspects of sharing both information and categorization schemes, but they are all person-centric - they are managed by the user primarily for their own benefit. In contrast the examples in knowledge management category are typically managed by some specific organization such as an employer on behalf of the organization's collective good.

%Discussion 
%
% The applications in this category are primarily exploiting the semi-structured data representation layer of the semantic web. By translating the many different data objects an individual has to manage (events, appointments, phone lists, mail lists, mail headers, filing categories, action lists) to a common RDF format then it is easier to build highly reusable and extensible tools and to link data across multiple formats. As in the last category, an issue with these applications from the point of view of our demonstrator goals is that the transformed data may remain hidden inside the application and the benefits of the approach may not be visible to anyone other than application developers (see Mozilla for example). These applications do involve some format translation and hence some schema mapping element but are typically not exploiting the semantics aspect of the semantic web in a particularly deep way.
%
%However, for applications where the sharing of information is a key feature and where some rich categorization or ontological structure is involved then this category can be an excellent source of demonstrators. It has the strong attraction that such applications can be immediately useful to a single individual or a small group and can then grow in value as the network of users grows - there is not the barrier of making substantial external data sets available or artificially stimulating a substantial "ignition" community that arises in some of the other categories.
