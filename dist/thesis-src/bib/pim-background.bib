%
% Abstract: This paper reports on the first 20 years of an empirical study of electronic support for filing and retrieving hardcopy documents and electronic files. A set of requirements for the ideal personal electronic filing system is documented, and the architecture of the system that is in use in the study is described. Sixty key questions associated with this topic are listed together with a summary of the answers found to date for each one. The paper concludes that electronic filing is feasible and effective, that the potential longevity of such systems introduces new challenges, and that it is time to start exploring how an electronic filing system can be used to support the acquisition, development and creation of knowledge.

% HISTORY
%%%%%%%%%
% EMAIL: http://livinginternet.com/e/ei.htm
% SNDMSG & READMAIL. Ray Tomlinson developed the first email application for the ARPANET in 1971, consisting of a program called SNDMSG for sending mail, and a program called READMAIL for reading mail. These early email programs had simple functionality and were command line driven, but established the basic model still in use today. In 1972, the commands MAIL and MLFL were added to the FTP program (see RFC 385) to provide standard network transport capabilities for email transmission. FTP sent a separate copy of each email to each recipient and provided the standard ARPANET email functionality until the early 1980's, when SMTP was developed to provide a more efficient protocol that. Among other improvements, SMTP enabled sending a single message to a domain with more than one addressee, after which the local server would locally copy the message to each recipient.

%1.1. Hierarchical file system
%[Saltzer, Jerome H. ]
% I think that Multics was the first to provide a hierarchical file system. The influence of that innovation can be found in virtually every modern operating system, including Unix, MacOS, DOS and Windows. 
%[THVV]The Multics file system was also the first to provide Access Control Lists (ACLs) on every entry.  In addition, the Multics file system supported long names on entries, multiple names on entries, symbolic links, storage quotas, removable devices, mandatory access control 
%
%There were technical borrowings in both directions. (This was before look-and-feel lawsuits and similar foolishness.) Unix has many features that Multics and CTSS had first, and many are obvious translations of Multics features.

% A system with the advanced graphics capability of the Alto will make extensive use of those facilities. The screen may be broken up into windows, and each window may be accessed in a different manner, if desired. Many Alto programs use only the mouse and screen windows for program control. For instance, the Neptune program is used for managing the contents of the Alto’s local disks (see photo 5d). A file may be deleted simply by touching the file name with the cursor, then touching the Delete spot on the screen with the cursor. As the cursor enters a new window, it may change shape, perhaps appearing as an arrow in one window and a paintbrush in another. 
% Examples of Alto software: Directory from the Neptune directory editor. The file names in black have been selected for further operations such as printing or erasure. The cursor is displayed as a cross in a circle.

% Information: an assembly of data in a comprehensive form capable of communication and use 
% 
% Knowledge: information evaluated and organised in the human mind so that it can be used purposefully
% Information Management (IM): an imprecise term covering the various stages of information processing from production to storage and retrieval to dissemination towards the better working of an organisation; information can be from internal and external sources and in any format
% Knowledge Management (KM): again an imprecise term very similar to information management the main difference is the sharing (mapping) of information and experience of many individuals towards the betterment of an organisation, rather than information remaining with different individuals working separately towards the same goal
