%Potential for increased flexibiity with computer
%Argues for content-addressable organization cf. Spatial metaphor which requires (kitchen analogy):
%·	natural spatial mapping between items and their location
%·	knowledge must be good enough so items can be found AOK
%·	granularity of locations not too big, not too small
%·	low-cost of scanning a location
%Spatial metaphor leads to the navigation problem and getting lost
%Alternative is "navigation by description" that matches human traits:
%·	not precise - fuzzy
%·	not logical, irrational
%·	not accurate, (computers currently force precision)}}
