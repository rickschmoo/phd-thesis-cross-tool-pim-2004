## Abstract:

Personal Information Management (PIM) describes the acquisition, organization, and retrieval
of information by an individual computer user. Studies have shown that many users struggle
to manage the volume and diversity of information that they accumulate. Much design activity
has been aimed at improving integration between different PIM tools, such as file and email
managers. However, in terms of making a systematic contribution to HCI knowledge, much of
this cross-tool design can be criticised for a lack of empirical grounding and evaluation.

The research described in this thesis employs a user-centered design methodology to deepen
understanding of PIM, and in particular to provide guidance for PIM-integration design. The
research is grounded in an exploratory study of file, email and bookmark management, which
is differentiated from previous studies by its cross-tool nature. The study offers several contributions
including observations of participants’ multiple organizing strategies – in both toolspecific
and cross-tool contexts. Also, many participants had significant numbers of overlapping
folders that appeared in multiple tool contexts. This finding informs the design of
WorkspaceMirror, a novel PIM-integration prototype, which allows a user to mirror changes
between their file, email and bookmark folders.

The final stage of the research is a dual-purpose field study, aimed at (1) evaluatingWorkspaceMirror,
and (2) investigating PIM behaviour over time. Participant feedback indicates that mirroring
is more appropriate for top-level folders, and illuminates a trade-off between organizational
consistency and organizational flexibility. The study also reveals the incremental nature
of changes in organizing strategy, and highlights the supporting nature of PIM. These and other
empirical findings are used to improve previous descriptive models of PIM behaviour. Furthermore,
a number of design and methodological guidelines are developed. In particular, the
author emphasizes the importance of assessing the strengths and weaknesses of PIM designs
from both tool-specific and cross-tool perspectives.
